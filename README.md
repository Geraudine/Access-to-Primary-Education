# 📚 Access to Primary Education – Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **access to primary education across countries and regions** using international education data.  
The objective is to evaluate enrollment patterns, regional disparities, and trends over time in order to understand **inequality in access to basic education**.

The analysis was conducted using **Excel, Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Power BI**, with a strong focus on **data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualization**.

## ❓ Research & Business Questions
- How does access to primary education vary across countries and regions?
- Which regions have the highest and lowest primary school enrollment rates?
- How has access to primary education evolved over time?
- Are enrollment gaps between countries decreasing or increasing?
- What role do economic and regional factors play in access to primary education?

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** World Bank – Education Statistics  
- **Format:** Excel / CSV  
- **Key Variables:**
  - Country
  - Region
  - Year
  - Primary school enrollment rate (%)
  - Population indicators (where applicable)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)
To ensure accuracy and consistency, the following steps were applied:
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized country and region names
- Handled missing and null enrollment values
- Corrected data types (numeric, text, year)
- Filtered irrelevant columns
- Restructured the dataset for time-series analysis
- Created calculated fields for comparison across regions

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Access to primary education is generally high globally, but significant disparities remain.
- Developing regions show lower enrollment rates compared to developed regions.
- Some countries have achieved near-universal primary education.
- Enrollment gaps have narrowed over time, indicating progress toward global education goals.
- Regional inequality remains a key challenge.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Increase investment in primary education infrastructure in low-access regions.
- Implement targeted policies to reduce regional disparities.
- Strengthen monitoring systems to track enrollment and attendance.
- Support inclusive education programs to reach marginalized populations.
